<section class=about>
    <p class=description>I'm an undergraduate student at Illinois Institute of Technology and will be beginning my senior year in August 2020. New Orleans is my hometown, and I consider being from the city a large part of my identity (seriously - I could talk about New Orleans for hours). Its culture has shaped me, and events such as Hurricane Katrina have taught me resilience.<br> <br> Disordered eating patterns developed throughout my childhood, dating as far back as sixth grade. On my 18th birthday, I weighed nearly 300 pounds. Friends encouraged me to try a class at a local CrossFit gym with them a few months later. I've lost over 100 pounds since and, though I did not know how my personal fitness journey would change my interests intitially, I have become passionate about helping others to reach their own health-related goals.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p class=description>I'm an Olympic weightlifter and hope to be competing by the end of 2020. I believe that accurate, well-communicated nutrition knowledge should be accessible to everyone. Nutrition coaches and dieticians in my workplaces receive a lot of my attention, as they have jobs I find undervalued and underutilized - if I had a source to answer questions I had about my state of health at a young age, then my course may have been very different. I want to work to bring adequate, effective health programs to education systems nationwide. </p>

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <h3 class=project>Consumer 'milk' study</h3>
		<p class=advisor>Advisors: Dr. Indika Edirisinghe and Dr. Britt Burton-Freeman</p>
		<p class=description>Currently running an FDA-funded study with August Neyrey, where we are evaluating consumer perception of dairy milks and plant-based milk alternatives on the market. August and I designed and are conducting the study in its entirety, including IRB application/amendments, creation of study protocols, participant briefing and debriefing, compensation, and data analysis. We plan to publish findings in a peer-reviewed academic journal. <br> <br>We hope to analyze whether the presence of nutrition labels, health claims, etc. alter consumers' opinions of products and/or purchasing decisions.</p>
		<h3 class=project>Add Health analysis</h3>
		<p class=advisor>Advisor: Dr. Nicole Legate</p>
		<p class=description>After being awarded the 2019 IIT Psychology Department Undergraduate Research Grant, I am working with a partner to analyze The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health - in short, the dataset is called Add Health. <br> <br> Add Health has interviewed a set of people for five 'waves,' beginning in their teenage years and repeating the interview once every decade to add a new 'wave' of data. <br> <br> Using SPSS, we are looking for connections between foster care status in youth and development of chronic illness or 'unhealthy' eating habits in adulthood. We will also look for the same connection to chronic illness and dietary choices for American Indian Add Health interviewees - another vulnerable population. <br> <br> To learn more about the dataset, visit the Add Health website <a href="https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
		<h3 class=project>'Faces' study</h3>
		<p class=advisor>Advisor: Dr. Nicole Legate</p>
		<p class=description>As two groups assigned in the PSYC204 course at Illinois Institute of Technology, we conducted a survey to understand how people form first impressions of others. Pictures of 120 faces, with each depicted race being represented an equal number of times in the set of pictures, were shown to the participants. They would rate reach face on a scale of 1-9 for a randomly-generated trait. There were a total of 13 traits - some were positive traits such as 'caring' or 'attractive,' while others were negative such as 'aggressive' or 'weird.' The ratings were done twice to ensure reliability of responses.<br> <br>For example, a participant could see an image of a white person making an angry facial expression and be asked to rate the face on a scale of 1-9 on the trait 'emotionally stable.' We wanted to see if, overall, there are patterns in how people make first impressions based on the gender or race of the rater. Similarly, we wanted to see if there were patterns in formation of first impressions based upon the race or gender of the face being rated. <br> <br>Click the links below to view the posters we presented at IIT's 2019 Undergraduate Research Day.
